## Showcase

This project was designed to demonstrate:

* Usage of React with Typescript and TailwindCSS
* Practice CRUD operations and array manipulation
* Create, delete, archive, or pin notes.
* Sync notes to browser's localStorage
* Drag and drop for sorting
* Keyboard shortcuts for convenience

## Usage example

Sometimes while I'm working, I come across trivial tasks that I need to quickly note down in order to save mental energy and avoid repeatedly reminding myself. Later, before leaving my desk, I can review these notes and ensure that I have completed all necessary tasks.
